# Combining Types - Boolean and Null

In our previous examples, we have set the types of properties as `string` and `integer`. But **what if you want to combine different types for a single property?**

Let's add a new property `hasAgreedToTerms` to the JSON object. This property should be a `boolean` value, but it can also be `null`.

```json highlightLineStart={4} 
{
  "name":"John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "hasAgreedToTerms": true,
}
```

### Boolean 

A `boolean` type can have two values: `true` or `false`. you can define a boolean type as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "boolean"
}
```

### Null

The `null` type has only one value: `null`. You can define a `null` type as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "null"
}
```

## Defining the Schema 

In JSON Schema, you can define multiple types by passing **an array of types** to the `type` field. 
**Example:**

```json 
{
  "type": ["boolean", "null"]
}
```



Now, try to modify the `hasAgreedToTerms` property on the <SideEditorLink/> to accept both `boolean` and `null` values.
