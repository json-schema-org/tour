# Regular Expressions in Strings

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for matching patterns in strings. They are widely used in programming languages and tools for tasks like searching, replacing, and validating strings.

Regular expressions itself are out of scope for this Tour, you can learn more about them in the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).

In this lesson, we will use regular expressions to validate the format `postalCode`, `phoneNumber` and `countryCode` fields in the JSON object.


```json highlightLineStart={6} 
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "postalCode": "385004",
  "phoneNumber": "84584898564",
  "countryCode": "IN"
}
```

## pattern Keyword

In JSON Schema, you can use the `pattern` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) to define a regular expression pattern that a string value must match.

**Example**

```
{
  "type": "string",
  "pattern": "^[0-9]{6}$"
}
```

Let's break down the regular expression `^[0-9]{6}$`:

- `^` asserts the start of the string.
- `[0-9]` matches any digit from 0 to 9.
- `{6}` specifies that the previous pattern should be repeated exactly 6 times.
- `$` asserts the end of the string.

Now, try to modify the `postalCode`, `phoneNumber` and `countryCode` fields in the <SideEditorLink/> with the below constraints in mind.

**Constraints:**
- The `postalCode` should be a string with a length of **exactly 6** characters and should **contain only digits.**
- The `phoneNumber` should be a string with a **minimum length of 10** characters and should **contain only digits**.
-  The `countryCode` should be a string with a **length of exactly 2** characters and should **contain only uppercase alphabets**. 

> **Hint:** to only allow uppercase alphabets, you can use the regular expression `[A-Z]` in your regex pattern.
