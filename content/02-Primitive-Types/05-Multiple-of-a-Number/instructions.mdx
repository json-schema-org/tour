# Multiple of a Number

Let's say you want to define a numeric property that should be a multiple of another number. We have added a new property, `hourlyWage`, in the JSON object.


```json highlightLineStart={4}
{
  "name":"John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "hourlyWage": 10
}
```

## multipleOf Keyword 

The `multipleOf` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) is used to define a number which is a multiple of another number. The value of the `multipleOf` keyword **must be a number, strictly greater than 0**

**Example**

```json
{
  "type": "number",
  "multipleOf": 5
}
```

Now, try to modify the JSON schema given in the <SideEditorLink/> such that `hourlyWage` property follows the given constraints. 

**Constraints**
- `hourlyWage` should be a **multiple of 0.25**
- `hourlyWage` should have **minimum value of 0** and **maximum value of 100**
