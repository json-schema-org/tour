# Constant Values

So far, we have used the `enum` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) to define a list of allowed values for a property. But **what if you want to define a single constant value for a property?**

Consider, you want to define a property `companyName` with a constant value `MyCompany`. any other value for `companyName` should be considered invalid.

```json highlightLineStart={4}
{
  "name":"John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "companyName": "MyCompany"
}
```

## const Keyword

The `const` keyword is used to define a single constant value for a property. The value of the `const` keyword **can be any valid JSON value**.

**Example**

```json
{
  "const": "MyCompany"
}
```

Now, try to add a new property `companyName` in the JSON schema in <SideEditorLink/> such that it should have a constant value `MyCompany`.

Just for practice, we will also **set the age to a constant value of 25**.




<GoodToKnowBox>
- Values defined in `const` are case-sensitive. So `MyCompany` and `myCompany` are considered different values.
- You don't need to add `type` keywords when using `const`. The `const` keyword itself implies the type of the value.
