# Decimal Numbers

So far in the tour, we have defined `age` as an integer. However, `integer` **does not allow decimal numbers**. If you want to allow decimal numbers, you can use the `number` type.

Consider a new property, `performanceRating`. 

```json highlightLineStart={4} 
{
  "name":"John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "performanceRating": 4.5
}
```

Now, Try to modify the `performanceRating` property on the <SideEditorLink/> to accept decimal numbers with **minimum** value as **0** and **maximum** value as **5**.

Also modify the `age` property to accept only `integer` values. <br/>
(There is no need to set the minimum and maximum values for the `age` property.)
