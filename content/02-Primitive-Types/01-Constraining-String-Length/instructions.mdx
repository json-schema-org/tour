# Primitive Types
Welcome to the Primitive Types module. In this module, you will learn about all the primitive types available in JSON Schema and some common constraints that can be applied to them. Let's start with the `string` type.


## Constraining String Length

Let's add two new fields `postalCode` and `phoneNumber` to the JSON object. Now, **How do you ensure that those fields have the correct length?**

```json highlightLineStart={4} highlightLineEnd={5}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "postalCode": "385004",
  "phoneNumber": "84584898564"
}
```

### minLength and maxLength

In JSON Schema, you can use the `minLength` and `maxLength` [keywords](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) to define the minimum and maximum length of a string.

**Example**

```json
{
  ...
  "postalCode": {
    "type": "string",
    "minLength": 6,
    "maxLength": 6
  }
}
```

Now, try to modify the `postalCode` and `phoneNumber` fields in the <SideEditorLink/> with the below constraints in mind.

**Constraints:**
- The `postalCode` should be a string with a length of **exactly 6** characters. 
- The `phoneNumber` should be a string with a **minimum length of 10** characters.
