# Objects
Welcome to the Objects module. In this module, you will learn all about the `object` type and constraints that can be applied to it in JSON Schema.

## Pattern Properties

So far, we have seen how to define the properties of an object in a [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema). Sometimes you want to say that, given a particular kind of property name, the value should match a particular schema. 

That's where `patternProperties` comes in: it maps regular expressions to schemas. If a property name matches the given regular expression, the property value must validate against the corresponding schema.


```json highlightLineStart={4}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "DEPT-001": "HR"
}
```

We will define a property that starts with `DEPT-` followed by department number of length 3 and the value should be a string which is department name. 

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type":"object",
  "patternProperties": {
    "^DEPT-[0-9]{3}$": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

Now, modify the schema provided in the <SideEditorLink/> on the right to permit `DEPT-*` properties. Additionally, ensure that the values for `DEPT-*` properties are constrained to be in **all capital letters.**

> **Hint:** Use the `patternProperties` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) to define the pattern for the property name and `pattern` keyword to define the pattern for the property value. you can set `pattern` to `^[A-Z]+$` to match all capital letters.

> We have set `additionalProperties` to `false` to disallow any additional properties. We will learn more about `additionalProperties` in the next lesson.
