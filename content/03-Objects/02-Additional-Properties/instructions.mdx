# Additional Properties

In the previous lesson, we have set `additionalProperties` to `false`. What does it mean? 

So far, we have seen how to define the properties of an object in a [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema). But **what if you want to specify constraints for the properties which you have not defined in the schema?**

The `additionalProperties` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) is used to control the handling of extra stuff, that is, properties whose names are not listed in the `properties` keyword or match any of the regular expressions in the `patternProperties` keyword. 

## Example I

By default any additional properties are allowed. you can set `additionalProperties` to `false` to disallow any additional properties.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {...},
    "age": {...}
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

The above schema will allow only `name` and `age` properties in the object. If any other property is present in the object, it will be considered invalid.

## Example II


You can also set `additionalProperties` to a schema to define the schema for the additional properties.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {...},
    "age": {...}
  },
  "additionalProperties": {
    "type": "string"
  }
}
```

The above schema will allow only `name` and `age` properties in the object. If any other property is present in the object, it should be of type `string`.

Now, try to modify the schema provided in the <SideEditorLink/> on the right to allow any additional properties of type `integer`.
