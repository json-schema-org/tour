# Applying Schema to Property Names

In JSON Schema, you can apply [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) to property names using the `propertyNames` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword). This keyword allows you to define a schema that restricts the property names of an object.

## Example 

We want to ensure that each property names are written in capital letters. We can use the `propertyNames` keyword to enforce this rule.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "propertyNames": {
    "pattern": "^[A-Z]+$"
  }
}
```

You are given an empty object schema in the <SideEditorLink/>. Modify it to ensure that it follows the below constraints:

1. The object should have at **least 2 properties**.
2. The **property names** should be written **in capital letters**, and should have **minimum length of 3 characters**.
3. The property **values should be either `string` or `integer`**.

> **Hints:**
> - For the first constraint, you can use the `minProperties` keyword.
> - For the second constraint, you can use the `propertyNames` keyword with the `pattern` keyword.
> - For the third constraint, you can use the `additionalProperties` keyword with the `type` keyword.
