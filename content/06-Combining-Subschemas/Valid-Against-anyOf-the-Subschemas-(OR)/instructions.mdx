# Valid Against anyOf the Subschemas (OR)

`anyOf` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) is used to define multiple [subschemas](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema). If the [instance](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#instance) is valid against **any one** of the subschemas, the document is considered valid.

You can think of `anyOf` as an **OR** operation. If the instance is valid against **any one** of the subschemas, the document is considered valid.

## Example

```json 
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "dateOfBirth": "1995-12-17"
}
```
We want to allow both `age` and `dateOfBirth` properties in the document. The document is valid if it has either `age` or `dateOfBirth` property. we can use `anyOf` keyword to define this condition. 


```json highlightLineStart={4} highlightLineEnd={7}
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {...},
  "anyOf": [
    {"required": ["age"]},
    {"required": ["dateOfBirth"]}
  ]
}
```

## Task 

Create a JSON schema that validates the following document. 

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "employeeType": "full-time",
  "salary": 50000,
  "hourlyRate": 25
}
```


Modify the [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) given to you in the <SideEditorLink/> to ensure that the document is valid if:
- It has either `salary` **or** `hourlyRate` property.
- It has both `salary` and `hourlyRate` properties.
