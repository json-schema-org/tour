# Valid Against oneOf the Subschemas (XOR)

When you want to ensure that an [instance](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#instance) is valid against **exactly one of** the [subschemas](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema), you can use the `oneOf` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword).

You can think of `oneOf` as an **XOR operation** between subschemas. If more than one subschema is valid, the instance is considered invalid.

## Example

Let's add a new property `dateOfBirth` to the JSON document.


```json highlightLineStart={4}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "dateOfBirth": "1999-01-01"
}
```


**Now you want to apply these conditions in the document:**
- if `age` is present, `dateOfBirth` should not be present, and vice versa.
- both `age` and `dateOfBirth` should not be present at the same time.
- if none of them is present, the document should be invalid.



## Schema Definition

To apply these conditions you can use `oneOf` keyword. `oneOf` ensures that **exactly one of** the specified subschemas is valid. 

We will combine using `oneOf` and `required`, to ensure that only one of the properties is present in the JSON document.


```json highlightLineStart={7} highlightLineEnd={10}
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "dateOfBirth": { "type": "string", "format": "date" }
  },
  "oneOf": [
    { "required": ["age"] },
    { "required": ["dateOfBirth"] }
  ]
}
```

> Notice the `format` keyword with `date` used in the `dateOfBirth` property. By default, `format` is just an annotation and **does not effect validation**. you can learn more about the format keyword [here](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string#format).

## Task

``` json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
}
```

You are given a [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) for the above JSON document in the <SideEditorLink/>. Using `oneOf` keyword, update schema to ensure that the `age` follows one of the below conditions:

- Either between 18 and 60 (inclusive) or,
- Greater then 65 (inclusive).

> **Hint:** use `minimum` and `maximum` keywords to define the range.
