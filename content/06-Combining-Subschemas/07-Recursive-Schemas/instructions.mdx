# Recursive Schemas

In JSON Schema, recursive schemas allow you to define schemas that refer to themselves. This can be useful when working with hierarchical data structures or when modeling recursive relationships.

```json
{
  
  "name":"John Doe",
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "links": [
        {
          "name": "Alice Doe",
          "links": []
        },
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Jack Doe",
      "links": []
    }
  ]
}
```

To define a recursive [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema), you can use the `$ref` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) to refer to the schema itself. For example:

```json
{
  "$defs": {
    "TreeNode": {
      "type":"array",
      "items": {
        "type":"object",
        "properties": {
          "name": { "type": "string" },
          "children": { "$ref": "#/$defs/TreeNode" }
        },
        "required": ["name", "children"]
      }
    }
  },
  "$ref": "#/$defs/TreeNode",
}
```

In the above example, the `TreeNode` schema refers to itself in the `children` property, creating a recursive structure.

## Task 

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "next":{
    "value": "Jane Doe",
    "next": {
      "value": "Alice Doe",
      "next": {}
    }
  }
}
```
You are given an incomplete JSON Schema in the right <SideEditorLink/>.
Define the `next` schema using recursive schemas. here `next` is a linked list of values.

> **Hint:**
> - inside `$defs` define a [subschemas](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) `next` that refers to itself and `null` as the base case.
> - You will define `next` property inside the `$defs/next` schema. the value of `next`property can be either `null` or the `next` schema itself.  you can use `anyOf` keyword to define multiple schemas.
