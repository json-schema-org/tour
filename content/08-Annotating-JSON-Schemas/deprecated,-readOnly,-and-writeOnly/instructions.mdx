# Deprecated, readOnly, and writeOnly

In this lesson, we will learn about the `deprecated`, `readOnly`, and `writeOnly` keywords in JSON Schema.

## Deprecated

The `deprecated` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) is a **boolean** that indicates that the [instance](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#instance) value the keyword applies to **should not be used and may be removed in the future**.

```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "deprecated": true
}
```

In the above example, the [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) is marked as deprecated. This means that the schema should not be used.

## readOnly and writeOnly

The boolean keywords `readOnly` and `writeOnly` are typically used in an API context.

`readOnly` indicates that a value should not be modified. It could be used to indicate that a **PUT** request that changes a value would result in a **400 Bad Request** response. 

`writeOnly` indicates that a value may be set, but will remain hidden. In could be used to indicate you can set a value with a **PUT** request, but it would not be included when retrieving that record with a **GET** request.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "readOnly": true
    },
    "age": {
      "type": "number",
      "writeOnly": true
    }
  }
}
```

Here, the `name` property is marked as `readOnly`, and the `age` property is marked as `writeOnly`.


## Task 

```json
{
  "name":{
    "firstName":"John",
    "lastName":"Doe"
  },
  "age":25
}

``` 
You are given schema of the above JSON object in <SideEditorLink/>.
- Add `deprecated` keyword to the schema. 
- Add `readOnly` in the schema to the `name` property 
- Add `writeOnly` to the `age` property.
  
You can use any value for these keywords.
