# Annotating JSON Schemas

JSON Schema includes a few [keywords](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema), that aren't strictly used for validation, but are used to describe parts of a schema. None of these "annotation" keywords are required, but they are encouraged for good practice, and can make your [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) "self-documenting".

## Title and Description

The `title` and `description` keywords are used to provide a human-readable title and description of the schema. 

These keywords are **not used for validation**, but can be used by tools and software to provide more information about the schema.

Here's an example of a schema with a title and description:

```json highlightLineStart={2} highlightLineEnd={3}
{
  "title": "Person",
  "description": "A person in the system",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {"type": "string"},
    "age": {"type": "integer"}
  }
}
```

# Task 
Add `title` and `description` to the schema given to you in the <SideEditorLink/>. You can use any title and description you like.
