# Additional Items in Tuples

There is no new [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) for the additional items in tuple arrays. You can use the `items` keyword to define the schema for the additional items in a tuple array.

We will use the same example as the previous lesson.
```json 
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "address": [123, "Main St", "Avenue", "NW"]
}
```

You can set the `items` keyword to `false` to disallow additional items in the tuple array.
**Example**

```json
{
  "type": "array",
  "items": false
}
```


Now, try to modify the `address` property on the <SideEditorLink/>, to allow **only string values as additional items** in the tuple array.

> **Hint:** add a [subschema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) to the `items` keyword to define the [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) for the additional items.
