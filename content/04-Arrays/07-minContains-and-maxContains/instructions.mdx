# minContains and maxContains

Previously, we learned how to use the `contains` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) to ensure that an array contains **at least one element** that matches a specific [subschema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema). 

However, there are scenarios where we need to ensure that an array contains a specific number of elements that match a subschema.

You can use the `minContains` and `maxContains` keywords along with `contains` to specify the minimum and maximum number of elements that an array must contain to be valid.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the `minContains` and `maxContains` keywords to ensure that an array contains exactly 2 elements that are less than 10.

```json
{
  "type": "array",
  "contains": {
    "type": "number",
    "maximum": 10
  },
  "minContains": 2,
  "maxContains": 2
}
```

## Task


```json highlightLineStart={4}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "workedHours": [9, 10, 8, 11]
}
```

Our employee has field called worked hours. We want to ensure that the `workedHours` array contains **at least 2 elements** that are **greater than or equal to 8 and less than or equal 12**. Modify the schema given to you in the <SideEditorLink/> to apply this constraint.
