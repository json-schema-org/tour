# Tuple Validation

We want to display the address of a person. The address is represented as an array of four elements: [`number`, `street_name`, `street_type`, `direction`]


```json highlightLineStart={4}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "address": [123, "Main St", "Avenue", "NW"]
}
```

each element of the `address` array have constraints of their own:

- `number` should be an integer
- `street_name` should be a string
- `street_type` can have only one value from the list: `["Street", "Avenue", "Boulevard"]`
- `direction` can have only one value from the list: `["NW", "NW", "SE", "SW"]`

## Schema definition

In such cases, you can use the `prefixItems` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) to define the [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) for each element of the tuple array.

**Example**

```json
{
  "type": "array",
  "prefixItems": [
    {"type": "integer"},
    {"type": "string"},
  ]
}
```

The above schema defines an array in which, the first element should be an `integer` and the second element should be a `string`.

Now, try to modify the `address` property on the <SideEditorLink/>, such that it follows the constraints mentioned above.
