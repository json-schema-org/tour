# Conditional Validation
Congratulations! You have made it so far. We will learn about conditional validation in this module


## What is Conditional Validation?

Conditional validation involves applying validation rules based on the presence or absence of other properties in the JSON document.

**For Example:**
- **dependentRequired**: if a property `A` is present, then property `B` must be present. 

- **dependentSchemas**: if a property `A` is present, then apply a [sub-schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) `B`.

- **if-then-else**: if a sub-schema `A` is valid then sub-schema `B` must be valid, else sub-schema `C` must be valid.

- **implications**: if sub-schema `A` is valid then sub-schema `B` must be valid.

we will see each of these in detail in the upcoming lessons.

## dependentRequired


Consider a scenario where you have a JSON document with two properties `name` and `age`. You want to make sure that if the `name` property is present, then the `age` property must also be present.

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 25
}
```

## Schema 

To achieve this, you can use the `dependentRequired` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) in JSON Schema. The `dependentRequired` keyword allows you to specify that a property is required if another property is present.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {...},
  "dependentRequired": {
    "name": ["age"]
  }
}
```

In the above [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema), we specify that if the `name` property is present, then the `age` property must also be present.

The value of the `dependentRequired` keyword is an object. Each entry in the object maps from the name of a property, *p*, to an array of strings listing properties that are required if *p* is present.


## Task 

```json 
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "creditCardNumber":"1234 5678 1234 5678",
  "address":"123 Main St",
}
```

You are given a *Schema* for the above JSON document in the <SideEditorLink/>. Update the schema to make sure that if the `creditCardNumber` property is present, then the `address` property must also be present.
