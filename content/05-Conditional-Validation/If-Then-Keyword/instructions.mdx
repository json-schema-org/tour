# if-then keyword

**Implication** is a logical operation that states that **if** condition `A` is true, **then** condition `B` must also be true. or in other words **A -> B** (pronounced, A implies B)

You can use the `if-then` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) to enforce this condition.

Consider an `isFullTime` Field. **If** `isFullTime` is true, **then** the `salary` field must be present.


```json highlightLineStart={3} highlightLineEnd={4}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "isFullTime": true,
  "salary": 50000
}
```
You can use the `if-then` keyword to enforce this condition.

**Example Schema**

```json highlightLineStart={8} highlightLineEnd={10}
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {...},
  "if": {"properties": {"isFullTime": {"const": true}}},
  "then": {"required": ["salary"]},
}
```

## Task


```json 
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "isStudent": true,
  "age": 25
}
```

You are given the [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) for the same JSON document in the <SideEditorLink/>. Modify the schema to enforce the below condition:

- **If** `isStudent` is true, **then** the `age` field must be present.
