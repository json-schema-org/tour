# Mutual Dependency
To understand mutual dependency, consider a JSON Document has two properties `firstName` and `lastName` 


If both of these properties are mutually dependent, then both of the below conditions must be satisfied:

- If `firstName` is present, then `lastName` must also be present.
- If `lastName` is present, then `firstName` must also be present.

Similar to the previous lesson, we can use the `dependentRequired` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) to enforce this mutual dependency.

**Example Schema**

```json highlightLineStart={12} highlightLineEnd={13}
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {...},
  "dependentRequired": {
    "firstName": ["lastName"],
    "lastName": ["firstName"]
  }
}
```

## Task 

```json 
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "creditCardNumber":"1234 5678 1234 5678",
  "address":"123 Main St",
}
```

You are given a *Schema* for the above JSON document in the <SideEditorLink/>. Update the schema to make sure that `creditCardNumber` and `address` are mutually dependent.
