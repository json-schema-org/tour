# Array of Objects



Now let's add `skills` field. Which is an array of objects. Each object in the array will have two properties `name` and `level`.

Both `name` and `level` are strings. 

```json highlightLineStart={4} highlightLineEnd={13}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "JavaScript",
      "level":"beginner"
    },
    {
      "name": "React",
      "level":"intermediate"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema for the Array of Objects

Start by defining `skills` as an array. set the `items` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword) to define the type of items in the array. Each item in the array will be an object with two properties `name` and `level`. See the below example.

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {...}
    }
  }
}
```
Now, try to modify the `skills` property in the [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) given to you in the <SideEditorLink/>, and make it an array of objects with `name` and `level` properties.
