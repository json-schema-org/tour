# Nesting Objects

You have learned to define an object [schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) with properties using the `properties` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword), and added properties with `string` and `integer` types .

In this lesson, you will learn how to nest objects within objects.
Let's divide the name property into the three separate components: `firstName`, `lastName`, and `middleName` 

```json highlightLineStart={3} highlightLineEnd={5}
{
  "name": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "middleName": "Smith"
  }
  "age": 25,
}
```

## Defining a Subschema

In JSON Schema, A [subschema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) refers to a schema that is nested within another schema. 

To nest objects within objects, you can define a property as an `object` with its own properties. We can call this nested object a subschema. 

**Example of Name subschema:**
```json
{
  ...
  "name": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {...},
  }
}
```


Now, try to modify the `name` property on the <SideEditorLink/> to add `firstName`, `lastName`, and `middleName` with type `string`.
