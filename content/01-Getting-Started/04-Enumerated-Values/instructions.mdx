# Enumerated Values

**How do you constrain a property to have a fixed set of values?** Enumerated values are used to solve this problem.


Consider we add a field `hobbies` to the document. The `hobbies` field can have only three possible values: `reading`, `writing`, and `painting`.


```json highlightLineStart={4}
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "hobbies": "reading"
}
```

To define the enumerated values in JSON Schema, use the `enum` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword).

**Example:**

```json 
{
  "department": {
    "enum": ["engineering", "marketing", 
            "sales", "HR", "finance"]
  }
}
```


Now, try to modify the `hobbies` property on the <SideEditorLink/> with `enum` constrain to only allow `reading`, `writing`, and `painting` values.

<GoodToKnowBox>
Values defined in `enum` are case-sensitive.

So `reading` and `Reading` are considered different values.

<GoodToKnowBox>
Instead of using `enum`, you can also use `anyOf` or `oneOf` to validate your data against a set of subschemas. They work similarly, but there's a key difference in how strict they are.

### anyOf (Recommended)

Generally `anyof` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/combining#anyOf)  is preferred as it validate data against **any** (one or more) of the given subschemas.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "department": {
    "anyOf": [
      { "const": "engineering" },
      { "const": "marketing" },
      { "const": "sales" },
      { "const": "HR" },
      { "const": "finance" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### oneOf 

The `oneOf` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/combining#oneOf) is stricter—it validates only when your data matches exactly one subschema. Since it has to check all possibilities to ensure only one matches, ***it can take longer to process***.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "department": {
    "oneOf": [
      { "const": "engineering" },
      { "const": "marketing" },
      { "const": "sales" },
      { "const": "HR" },
      { "const": "finance" }
    ]
  }
}
```

In this department example, both approaches work identically since each value can only match one const at a time. But stick with `anyOf` as a general practice—it'll save you trouble down the road when your schemas get more complex.
