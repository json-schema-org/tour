title: Your First Schema 
description: "JSON Schema is a language used for defining the structure and constraints of a JSON document. A JSON Schema is a JSON document that you can use to validate or document another JSON, which we call a JSON instance. JSON Schema is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be validated against a predefined structure. This ensures data consistency and helps prevent errors in applications that consume or produce JSON data. It's also valuable for documenting the expected format of JSON data, making it easier for developers to understand and work with APIs and data structures. JSON Schema supports a wide range of validation rules, including data types, formats, ranges, and dependencies between properties."

# JSON Schema Tour
Welcome to the JSON Schema Tour! In this interactive tour you will be introduced to JSON Schema. You will learn how to use **JSON Schema [draft](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#draft) 2020-12** to validate JSON documents.


## Are there any prerequisites?
**No!** You just need to know what [JSON](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/what-is-json) is.

## What is JSON Schema?

JSON Schema is a language used for defining the structure  and constraints of a JSON document.  A [_JSON Schema_](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) is a JSON document that you can use to validate or document another JSON, which we call a JSON [instance](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#instance).

## First Schema 
Let's start with a simple example.
Consider you have a JSON document of an employee:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25
}
```
 This JSON document has two properties:
 - `name` with value `John Doe` (string)
 - `age` with value `25` (integer)

Define the `age` property and constrain its `type` to be `integer`!
