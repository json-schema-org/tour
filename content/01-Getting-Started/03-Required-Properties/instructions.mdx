# Required Properties

In the previous example, the `name` had three properties: `firstName`, `lastName`, and `middleName`. <br/>
**What if you want to make `firstName` and `lastName` properties mandatory?**

```json
{
  "name": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "middleName": "Smith"
  }
  "age": 25,
}
```

## Schema Definition

In JSON Schema, you can define required properties using the `required` [keyword](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#keyword).

Properties listed in the `required` array **must be present** in the object.
if those properties are not present, the JSON data is considered invalid.


**Example**
```json
{
  ...
  "name": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {...},
    "required": ["property1", "property2"],
  }
}
```


Now, try to modify the `name` property on the <SideEditorLink/> and add `firstName` and `lastName` as **required** properties.
